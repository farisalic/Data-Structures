# Rational Class project
In this project I implemented the *Rational* data type that simulates work with rational numbers (fractions). This data type contains the necessary constructors, the possibilities of arithmetic, relational and logical operations. All operations are optimal, which means that if possible, the numerator and denominator will be shortened with the greatest common denominator.
