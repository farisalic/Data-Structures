# Postfix Calculator project
In this project I implemented a postfix calculator with a support for basic arithmetical operations (+,-,*,/). Postfix notation or postfix notation system is a mathematical notation in which each operator follows all of its operands, and is better known as reverse Polish notation (or simply RPN). This project was implemented in a *PostfixCalc* class using *Stack* data structure from the standard library. 

Input of operands and operators is done via standard console input. Input arguments are space separated. Operands can be positive and negative numbers, while basic operations are one character.
It is necessary to implement input reading in such a way that each line of input represents one mathematical expression for which the result of the expression or error information is printed, after which the user enters the next line of input, which is a new expression.
