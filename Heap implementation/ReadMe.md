# Heap data structure implementation
This project showcases my implementation of *Heap* data structure using an array. This structure implements, among other features, the following:
* Correct behavior of constructors and destructors,
* inserting a new element and arranging it as a max heap,
* *max* method which returns a reference to the maximum element,
* the *removeMax* method, which removes and returns the value of the maximum element which was removed from the heap,
* *operator<<* which prints the heap using preorder traversal.
