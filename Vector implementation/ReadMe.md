# Vector data structure
In this project I implemented a generic vector container inside of class called *MojVektor* that has similar functionalities as *std::vector*. The container is implemented as a list with an array, but it is extended with the possibility of using random access iterators. The declaration of all methods is given in the *.hpp* file.
