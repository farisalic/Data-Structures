# Map data structure implementation
This project showcases my implementation of a *Map* container that represents an associative container implemented with a binary search tree approach.
Within a node of this tree, there are two fields, a key and a value. The internal organization of the tree is done by key. Indexing and searches of the tree are done by key, but the returned result is the field value located in that node which enables efficient searching and manipulation of data based on keys.
